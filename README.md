# M-NSTA: Multi-Modal Neural-Spatial-Temporal Analysis

### The Forensic Backbone for Digital Truth | A Sirraya Labs Open-Source Initiative

**M-NSTA** is a comprehensive forensic framework designed to detect sophisticated synthetic media by validating the immutable physical and geometric properties of the human subject. Developed at **Sirraya Labs**, M-NSTA moves beyond surface-level pixel analysis, anchoring authenticity in the **"Structural Truth"** of a scene.

## 🔬 Scientific Methodology

M-NSTA operates on the principle of **Multi-Modal Verification**. To pass a Sirraya integrity check, a video must prove its authenticity across three distinct scientific dimensions:

### 1. Neural Layer: Quantum-Inspired Manifolds

Traditional CNN-based detection is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. M-NSTA utilizes **Density Matrix Formalism** to model facial landmarks as entangled states.

* **Approach:** Analyzes the global semantic manifold of the face.
* **Detection:** Identifies high-dimensional correlation breaks that occur when AI generative models "hallucinate" micro-expressions or facial symmetry.

### 2. Spatial Layer: 3D Geometric Integrity

Synthetic overlays often fail to maintain perfect 3D structural consistency when the subject moves through space.

* **Approach:** Projects 2D landmarks into a rigid 3D spatial matrix.
* **Detection:** Uses **Procrustes Analysis** to detect "Z-axis warping." If the distance between fixed cranial points fluctuates during head rotation, the system flags a "Spatial Violation."

### 3. Temporal Layer: Biophysical Photoplethysmography (rPPG)

The most difficult element for AI to simulate is the human cardiovascular system.

* **Approach:** Uses **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** to extract micro-color variations in the skin's green channel caused by blood flow.
* **Detection:** Validates the presence of a rhythmic, biological heartbeat. No pulse = No authenticity.

## 🛡 AI Safety & Morality Mission

As the Principal Investigator of Sirraya Labs, I have launched this project as a **Fully Open-Source** endeavor. In 2026, the ability to distinguish reality from simulation is a fundamental human necessity.

**We invite researchers to join our "Morality First" mission:**

* **Adversarial Red-Teaming:** Help us find the breaking points of our Spatial Matrix.
* **Demographic Parity:** Contribute to our datasets to ensure rPPG accuracy across all ethnicities and lighting conditions.
* **Ethical Governance:** Collaborate on the integration of **UDNA (Universal Digital Network Architecture)** to ensure forensic results are decentralized and tamper-proof.
